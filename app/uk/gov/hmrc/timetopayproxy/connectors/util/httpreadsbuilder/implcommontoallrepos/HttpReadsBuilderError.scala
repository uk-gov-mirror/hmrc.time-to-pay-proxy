/** This trait exists so that repo-specific error classes don't have to appear in the `HttpReadsBuilder` unit tests.
  * If `HttpReadsBuilder` returns only instances of this trait, all copies of `HttpReadsBuilder` across our repos
  *   can be consistent, and the transformation into repo-specific errors is only declared here.
  *
  * Implementations of this trait have all the data necessary to create a connector error, no matter what those
  *   classes might be. If any data is missing from these classes (e.g. timestamps), refactor them to include it,
  *   and use that data in the conversions of this file that need it.
  *
  * @tparam StoredServiceError The type of connector/service error we are required to convert this into.
  *                            It's covariant because if we store a repo-specific service error, we have no choice but to return it.
  */
/* ℹ️ Note about updating this file: ℹ️
 * This file must be kept consistent with every copy in the other debt-transformation repos.
 * The most complex features are required by time-to-pay, so that is the best place to test any refactoring.
